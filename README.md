# Laradock Guidelines

## Step 1: Install Laradock

Laradock is the docker version of Laravel homestead. Unlike homestead, it is highly scalable and production-ready.
Go to https://laradock.io/ and check out their wonderful quick start guide.
Git clone of https://github.com/laradock/laradock and place it in your Project folder. Folder structure should look like this:

```bash
+ laradock
+ project-1
+ project-2
```
